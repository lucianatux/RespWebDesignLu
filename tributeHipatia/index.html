        <h3 class="caption">Tribute to Hypatia</h3>
        <p id="tribute-info">
          Hypatia (born c. 350–370; died 415 AD) was a neoplatonist philosopher,
          astronomer, and mathematician, who lived in Alexandria. She was a
          prominent thinker in Alexandria where she taught philosophy and
          astronomy. <br />Although preceded by Pandrosion, another Alexandrine
          female mathematician, she is the first female mathematician whose life
          is reasonably well recorded. <br />
          Hypatia was renowned in her own lifetime as a great teacher and a wise
          counselor. <br />
          She improved the design of the primitive astrolabes —instruments to
          determine the positions of the stars on the celestial vault— and
          invented the densimeter. <br />
          She wrote a commentary on Diophantus's thirteen-volume Arithmetica.
          <br />
          Hypatia constructed astrolabes and hydrometers. <br />
          She taught many students, including Synesius, the future bishop of
          Ptolemais. <br />
          Ancient sources record that Hypatia was widely beloved by pagans and
          Christians alike and that she established great influence with the
          political elite in Alexandria. <br />
          Towards the end of her life, Hypatia advised Orestes, the Roman
          prefect of Alexandria.<br />
          In March 415 AD, she was murdered by a mob of Christians led by a
          lector named Peter. <br />

          Hypatia's murder shocked the empire and transformed her into a "martyr
          for philosophy", leading future Neoplatonists such as Damascius to
          become increasingly fervent in their opposition to Christianity.
          <br />
          During the Middle Ages, Hypatia was co-opted as a symbol of Christian
          virtue and scholars believe she was part of the basis for the legend
          of Saint Catherine of Alexandria. <br />
          During the Age of Enlightenment, she became a symbol of opposition to
          Catholicism. <br />
          In the nineteenth century, European literature, especially Charles
          Kingsley's 1853 novel Hypatia, romanticized her as "the last of the
          Hellenes". <br />
          In the twentieth century, Hypatia became seen as an icon for women's
          rights and a precursor to the feminist movement.
